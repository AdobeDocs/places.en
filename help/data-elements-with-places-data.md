# Experience Platform Launch data elements with Places data {#launch-data-places}

## Data elements

Data elements are the building blocks for your data dictionary or data map. You can use data elements to collect, organize, and deliver data across marketing and ad technology.

A data element is a variable whose value can be mapped to query strings, URLs, cookie values, JavaScript variables, and so on. In Experience Platform Launch, you can reference this value by its variable name. The collection of data elements becomes the dictionary of defined data that you can use to build your rules (events, conditions, and actions), and the data dictionary is shared across Experience Platform Launch and can be used with the Places extension.

For more information about data elements, see [Data Elements](https://docs.adobelaunch.com/launch-reference/managing-resources/data-elements) .
