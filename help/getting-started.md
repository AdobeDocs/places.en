# Getting started {#getting-started}

## Get provisioned to use Adobe Places 

Places requires special provisioning context with your regular Adobe Experience Platform provisioning context. 

To get provisioned, complete the following tasks:

* In the Admin Console, ensure that your organization is provisioned with Places. 

  If you are not the Adobe administrator, contact the administrator to ensure the Places context in Admin Console.

* Ensure you are listed as a user under the Places and Launch product contexts in the Admin Console.

  For more information, see [Adding a user to Launch and Places](help/adding-a-user-to-launch-places.md).
* Ensure your mobile app property is configured in Adobe Launch with the Places extension installed. 

  For more information, see [Adobe Places (Beta)](https://aep-sdks.gitbook.io/docs/using-mobile-extensions/places-extension-1). 

* If your company has multiple Adobe organizations, ensure that you always select the organization that is provisioned for Places.

  This allows you to add your POIs and Libraries.
