To use Places, complete the following tasks: 

## 1. Get provisioned to use Places

Places requires special provisioning context with your regular Adobe Experience Platform provisioning context.

To get provisioned, complete the following tasks:

* In the Admin Console, ensure that your organization is provisioned with Places.

  If you are not the Adobe administrator, contact the administrator to ensure the Places context in Admin Console.

* Ensure you are listed as a user under the Places and Experience Platform Launch product contexts in the Admin Console.  

   For more information, see *Adding a user to Experience Platform Launch and Places* in [Places FAQs](/help/places-faqs.md).

* Ensure your mobile app property is configured in Experience Platform Launch with the Places extension installed.

  For more information, see [Places extension](/help/places-ext-aep-sdks/places-extension/places-extension.md).

* If your company has multiple Adobe organizations, ensure that you always select the organization that is provisioned for Places.  

  This allows you to add your POIs and Libraries.

## 2. Configure the Places extension and Places Monitor extension
