## Using Location Service

To use Location Service, complete the following tasks: 
 
### 1. Ensure that your user is provisioned to use Location Service
 
The Location Service product context is available with all Experience Cloud organizations. 
 
* Ensure that you are listed as a user under the Location Service and Experience Platform Launch product contexts in the Admin Console.  
 
   For more information, see *Adding a user to Experience Platform Launch and Location Service* in [Frequently asked questions](/help/places-faqs.md).
 
  
### 2. Create your POIs
 
Points of Interest (POI) are geo-fences that you create for your organizations, and you can create POIs in one of the following ways:

* Using the Location Service user interface. 

  For more information, see [Places Service overview](/help/poi-mgmt-ui/places-services-overview.md). 

* Using the APIs from Places Web service. 

  For more information, see [Web Service API](/help/web-service-api/places-web-services.md).
