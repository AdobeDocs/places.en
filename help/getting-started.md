## Using Places Service

To use Places Service, complete the following tasks: 
 
### 1. Ensure that your user is provisioned to use Places Service
 
The Places Service product context is available with all Experience Cloud organizations. 
 
* Ensure that you are listed as a user under the Places Service and Experience Platform Launch product contexts in the Admin Console.  
 
   For more information, see *Adding a user to Experience Platform Launch and Places Service* in [Frequently asked questions](/help/places-gain-access.md).
 
  
### 2. Create your POIs
 
Points of Interest (POI) are geo-fences that you create for your organizations, and you can create POIs in one of the following ways:

* Using the Places Service user interface. 

  For more information, see [Places Service overview](/help/poi-mgmt-ui/poi-mgmt-ui-overview.md). 

* Using the APIs from Places Web service. 

  For more information, see [Web Service API](/help/web-service-api/places-web-services.md).


### 3. Configure the Places extension

For more information about configuring the Places extension, see the following information:

### 4. (Optional) Implement a region monitoring solution

If you plan to do active region monitoring, you will need to implement directly with operating system. For more information, see the following documents:

* iOS - [CoreLocation documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/corelocation/monitoring_the_user_s_proximity_to_geographic_regions) 

* Android - [Location documentation](https://developer.android.com/training/location/geofencing)
