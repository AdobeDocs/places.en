# Getting started {#getting-started}

Here are the tasks you need to complete before you can use Location Service.

## 1. Get provisioned to use Location Service

Location Service requires special provisioning context with your regular Adobe Experience Platform provisioning context.

To get provisioned, complete the following tasks:

* In the Admin Console, ensure that your organization is provisioned with Location Service.   

  If you are not the Adobe administrator, contact the administrator to ensure the Location Service context in Admin Console.

* Ensure you are listed as a user under the Location Service and Experience Platform Launch product contexts in the Admin Console.  

   For more information, see [Adding a user to Experience Platform Launch and Location Services](/help/adding-a-user-to-launch-loc-services.md).

* Ensure your mobile app property is configured in Experience Platform Launch with the Places extension installed.

  For more information, see [Places extension](/help/configure-places-in-the-sdk/places-extension/places-extension.md).

* If your company has multiple Adobe organizations, ensure that you always select the organization that is provisioned for Experience Platform Location Services.  

  This allows you to add your POIs and Libraries.

## 2. Configure the Places extension and Places Monitor extension

For more information about configuring the Places extension and Monitor extension, see [Places extension](/help/configure-places-in-the-sdk/places-extension/places-extension.md) and [Places Monitor extension](/help/configure-places-in-the-sdk/places-monitor-extension/places-monitor-extension.md).

## 3. Create your libraries and POIs

You can create libraries and POIs in one of the following ways:

* By using the web services. 

  For more information, see [Location Service web services](/help/loc-services-rest-apis/loc-services-web-services.md).

* By using the Location Services UI. 

  For more information, see [Location Service UI](/help/loc-services-database-management-1/loc-services-database-management.md).
