# Launch Rules with Places data

Adobe Experience Platform Launch is a rule-based system and looks for user interaction and associated data. When the criteria outlined in your rules are met, the rule triggers the extension, script, or HTML that you identified. You can build rules to integrate the data and functionality of marketing and ad tech that unifies disparate products into one solution. For more information about rules, see [Rules](https://docs.adobelaunch.com/launch-reference/managing-resources/rules) and [Create a rule](https://docs.adobelaunch.com/launch-reference/managing-resources/rules#create-a-rule).
