# Batch APIs {batch-apis}

The batch APIs allow you to create, update, or delete multiple POIs at the same time.

To help you complete a batch import of your POIs from a `.csv` file into your organization's Places database, use the set of Python scripts. You can download the zip file of these scripts [here](https://github.com/adobe/places-scripts). For instructions on how to use the scripts, see the included README file.

You can use the batch APIs to complete the following tasks:

* [Create multiple POIs](/help/places-rest-apis/api-usage/manage-pois/create-multiple-pois.md)
* [Update multiple POIs](/help/places-rest-apis/api-usage/manage-pois/update-multiple-pois.md)
* [Delete multiple POIs](/help/places-rest-apis/api-usage/manage-pois/delete-multiple-pois.md)
