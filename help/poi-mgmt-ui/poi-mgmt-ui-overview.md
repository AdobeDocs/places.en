# Point of interest management interface overview {#management-ui-overview}

POIs and libraries are created and managed in the Location Service database by using the Location Service UI.

* To create a library or manage multiple libraries, see [Manage libraries](/help/poi-mgmt-ui/manage-libraries-in-the-places-ui.md).
* To create a POI, see [Create a POI](/help/poi-mgmt-ui/create-a-poi-ui.md).
* To manage multiple POIs, see [Manage previously created POIs](/help/poi-mgmt-ui/managing-pois-in-the-places-ui.md).
* To preform a bulk import of POIs, see [Bulk import of POIs](/help/poi-mgmt-ui/bulk-upload-pois.md).
