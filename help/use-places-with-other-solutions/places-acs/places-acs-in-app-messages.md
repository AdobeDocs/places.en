# In-App messaging with Places Service {#in-app-messages-loc-service}

This information helps you understand how you can use Places Service information to send In-App Messages or Local Notifications.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, complete the following tasks:

* Have a mobile application configured with the Adobe Experience Platform Mobile SDK, including the [Adobe Campaign Standard extension](https://aep-sdks.gitbook.io/docs/using-mobile-extensions/adobe-campaign-standard). 

* Integrate the [Adobe Experience Platform Mobile SDK](https://aep-sdks.gitbook.io/docs/getting-started/get-the-sdk) into your app.
* Add the [Adobe Campaign Standard Extension](https://aep-sdks.gitbook.io/docs/using-mobile-extensions/adobe-campaign-standard) to your mobile app configuration.

* [Create a POI](/help/poi-mgmt-ui/create-a-poi-ui.md) in the Places Service POI management interface.

* Install and configure the [Places extension](/help/places-ext-aep-sdks/places-extension/places-extension.md) and [Places Monitor extensions](/help/places-ext-aep-sdks/places-monitor-extension/places-monitor-extension.md) in your mobile application.

## Sending an In-App message based on a geo-fence entry or exit

1. In your Adobe Campaign Standard instance, click **[!UICONTROL Create In-App message]**.
1. For the message type, select **[!UICONTROL Target all users of a Mobile application]**.
1. Click **[!UICONTROL Next]** and type the general details.
1. In the left pane, verify that you can use a variety triggers that are related to Places Services.

    * You can choose to have the in-app message display if the user has entered a POI geo-fence.
    * You can also use metadata that is defined in the Places Services UI to filter audience.
 
    In the example below, you can trigger an in-app message that is displayed only to users who enter one of the vacation resorts that are participating in a free drink program, and you want to send those users a coupon when they arrive.

1. Click the **[!UICONTROL Next]** to finish creating the In-app message for delivery.

    To test the in-app message delivery, launch the application in Xcode or Android studio and use the location simulator to select a POI hat fits the messaging criteria.

Using Places Services with Adobe Campaign Standard gives you a powerful tool to segment and target your messaging to users based on geo-fence entries and exits. This integration allows you to build more personalized and contextual use cases.
