#### Sending In-App Messages based on Geo-fence entry or exit

1. In your Adobe Campaign Standard instance, click **Create In-App message**.
2. For the message type select **Target all users of a Mobile application**.
3. Click **Next** and type the general details on the next screen.
4. Youâ€™ll see on the left sidebar that you can now use a variety triggers related to Places.
5. You can choose to have the in-app message display if the user has entered a POI geo-fence.
6. You can also use metadata that defined in the Location Services UI to filter audience.
 
    In this example I want to trigger an in-app message shown only to users that have entered one of my vacation resorts that are participating in a free drink program. I want to send my users a coupon when they arrive.

To test the in-app message delivery, launch the application in Xcode or Android studio and use the location simulator to select a point of interest that will fit the messaging criteria.
